While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research."
