    <p>This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>How did China achieve such remarkable growth in science and technology over the past two decades? A common explanation points to the rapid expansion of its research university system, which produces an impressive number of graduates and research outputs <span class="citation" data-cites="Simon_Cao:2009a">(<a href="#ref-Simon_Cao:2009a" role="doc-biblioref">D. F. Simon and Cao 2009</a>)</span>. Visitors to China often marvel at how modern and expansive these institutions have become <span class="citation" data-cites="Rhoads_Wang_etal:2014a">(<a href="#ref-Rhoads_Wang_etal:2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Rhoads et al. 2014</a>)</span>. Notably, this transformation began in 1999 <span class="citation" data-cites="Hayhoe_Zha:2005a">(<a href="#ref-Hayhoe_Zha:2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Hayhoe and Zha 2005</a>)</span>, and in just over two decades, the higher education system has grown to include 47 million students, with several Chinese universities now ranked among the world’s top institutions. On the research front, China was once a relatively marginal player, but since 2000, its growth in research output has been nothing short of extraordinary <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhou_Leydesdorff:2006a">(<a href="#ref-Zhou_Leydesdorff:2006a" role="doc-biblioref">P. Zhou and Leydesdorff 2006</a>)</span>. By 2018, China surpassed the United States as the leading producer of research papers, according to Web of Science data <span class="citation" data-cites="Tollefson:2018a">(<a href="#ref-Tollefson:2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Tollefson 2018</a>)</span>. More importantly, it has excelled not only in quantity but also in quality: China overtook the U.S. in producing top-cited scientific papers in 2019 <span class="citation" data-cites="Wagner_Zhang_etal:2022a">(<a href="#ref-Wagner_Zhang_etal:2022a" role="doc-biblioref">Wagner, Zhang, and Leydesdorff 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The institutional growth is equally impressive. According to <em>Nature</em> magazine’s institutional index, which tracks output in highly selective scientific journals, only four Chinese institutions ranked among the global top 30 in 2016. By 2024, that number had risen to 13, with 7 Chinese institutions ranked in the global top 10 <span class="citation" data-cites="The-Economist:2024a">(<a href="#ref-The-Economist:2024a" role="doc-biblioref">The Economist 2024</a>)</span>. This rapid rise prompts an important question: How did China achieve such scientific and educational prominence in such a short period?</p>
<p>This paper seeks to provide a fresh historical analysis to address this puzzle. While conventional explanations often highlight the relationship between China and the United States (i.e. <span class="citation" data-cites="Crow:2022a">Crow (<a href="#ref-Crow:2022a" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="Hao_Hua:2023a">Hao and Hua (<a href="#ref-Hao_Hua:2023a" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>), we argue that a critical, yet overlooked, player in China’s rise in science and technology is Hong Kong. This perspective brings to light an underappreciated dimension of China’s higher education and S&amp;T development.</p>
<p>At first glance, the suggestion that Hong Kong played a vital role in China’s scientific rise might seem counterintuitive. Commentators such as Cornell’s Eswar Prasad have argued that Hong Kong’s traditional role as an intermediary—providing trade routes and capital market access to Chinese firms—is no longer crucial <span class="citation" data-cites="Prasad:2019a">(<a href="#ref-Prasad:2019a" role="doc-biblioref">Prasad 2019</a>)</span>. In the context of modern finance and trade, Prasad suggests, China no longer needs Hong Kong’s services. However, this analysis overlooks Hong Kong’s continuing influence in the domains of higher education and S&amp;T, where it has served as a key source of intellectual and scientific dynamism for China. Contrary to the belief that Hong Kong lacks scientific influence, the city has maintained robust and innovative ties with mainland China, particularly in S&amp;T.</p>
<p>Despite its reputation as a finance-driven, business-oriented city, Hong Kong has quietly fostered a strong academic and scientific community, especially in collaboration with mainland institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="Woo:2007a">(<a href="#ref-Woo:2007a" role="doc-biblioref">Woo 2007</a>)</span>. Although careers in science are not commonly aspired to in Hong Kong, and the city’s scientific sector pales in comparison to its booming finance and legal industries, the region’s universities have played a pivotal role in nurturing the development of China’s S&amp;T capacity.</p>
<p>Over the years, Hong Kong’s scientific community has cultivated close ties with mainland counterparts, particularly in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Beijing. Hong Kong’s relative autonomy, academic freedom, and generous support for research have made it an attractive hub for mainland students and scholars, creating a fertile ground for intellectual exchange and collaboration. This paper builds on <span class="citation" data-cites="Postiglione:2005a">Postiglione (<a href="#ref-Postiglione:2005a" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>’s earlier claim of Hong Kong’s bridging role between mainland China and Western academia, strengthening this argument with newer and more granular data</p>
<p>This paper argues that the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China has been a crucial, yet underappreciated, driver of China’s higher education and scientific success. Existing accounts of China’s educational rise often rely heavily on interviews or official statistics, but these explanations tend to overlook the long-term historical trends that have shaped both Hong Kong’s and the mainland’s educational landscapes. By focusing on the historical evolution of this cross-border academic relationship, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of China’s development in science and technology.</p>
<p>We propose that this historical process is evolutionary in nature, guided by forward-thinking educators who envisioned a mutually beneficial relationship long before formal mechanisms for collaboration were in place. Despite the absence of formal agreements for student mobility or funding mechanisms in the early stages, educational leaders from both Hong Kong and the mainland spearheaded a collaborative effort that has since flourished. This relationship emerged during a unique period in the 1990s, when Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were just beginning to gain momentum, mainland students were actively seeking high-quality opportunities for advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese diaspora in S&amp;T, who had established themselves in academia, chose to join Hong Kong universities, further nurturing the influx of talented students.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China succeeded despite ideological and cultural differences <span class="citation" data-cites="Chi:2014a">Shaw (<a href="#ref-Shaw:2013a" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. When Hong Kong’s research programs gained momentum in the 1990s, even before the handover, they welcomed mainland students with open arms. This partnership created a dynamic network that combined the strengths of both regions: the mainland’s steady supply of motivated and well-prepared young talent, and Hong Kong’s free academic environment and generous scholarship, which allowed these students to thrive. The result was a mutually reinforcing system of academic exchange that contributed significantly to China’s rapid rise in science and technology.</p>

<section id="literature-review-and-theoretical-framework" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Literature Review and Theoretical framework</h1>
<p>The development of the higher education sector has been the subject of extensive research, analyzed from a variety of perspectives. However, much of the scholarship falls into two broad camps: structuralist and culturalist approaches. While each offers valuable insights, both perspectives risk simplifying the complex dynamics at play in the evolution of China’s higher education system. Our theoretical departure seeks to go beyond these views by examining the role of organizational capacity and institutional agency, specifically how actors within China’s universities engage in strategic decision-making, experimentation, and learning.</p>
<section id="the-structuralist-perspective" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-structuralist-perspective"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Structuralist Perspective</h2>
<p>The structuralist perspective emphasizes external, systemic forces that shape the actions and growth of universities. In the Chinese context, this framework highlights the influence of government directives, global competition, and institutional environments as key drivers behind the rapid development of the S&amp;T sectors. Scholars like <span class="citation" data-cites="Rhoads_Wang_etal:2014a">Rhoads et al. (<a href="#ref-Rhoads_Wang_etal:2014a" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> argue that Chinese universities were transformed through four simultaneous strategies: focusing on entrepreneurship, fostering international collaborations, recruiting overseas talent, and heavily investing in research capacity via initiatives like Projects 985 and 211.</p>
<p>From this perspective, Chinese universities appear as passive entities, responding to external pressures such as global competition or state-led initiatives. Programs like Project 985 are seen as critical to China’s rise in global rankings, with state investment as the principal driver of growth. Similarly, the structuralist view emphasizes the role of internationalization, where Chinese universities formed joint-venture campuses, recruited foreign faculty, and built global partnerships in response to competitive pressures.</p>
<p>However, this narrative, while useful, presents a somewhat deterministic view of institutional development. It assumes a linear relationship between external pressures and institutional responses, overlooking the active role universities play in shaping their own trajectories. For instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="Jin_Horta:2018a">Jin and Horta (<a href="#ref-Jin_Horta:2018a" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> show that even within the same university, different schools adopt diverse strategies for internationalization, reflecting internal negotiations and unique organizational cultures.</p>
<p>Thus, while the structuralist approach effectively highlights how Chinese universities responded to systemic pressures, it does not account for the internal dynamics and contradictions that complicate this narrative. Universities are not simply shaped by external forces but are sites of complex interactions among various stakeholders, each negotiating their own interests and goals. This becomes particularly evident when we consider the internal conflicts that emerged as managerial reforms clashed with traditional academic values <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang_Jones:2021a">(<a href="#ref-Wang_Jones:2021a" role="doc-biblioref">Wang and Jones 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-culturalist-perspective" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-culturalist-perspective"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Culturalist Perspective</h2>
<p>In contrast to the structuralist approach, the culturalist perspective emphasizes the importance of historical legacies and cultural traditions in shaping the development of China’s higher education system. Scholars in this camp, such as Yang Rui, argue that Chinese universities have long prioritized serving national goals while pursuing global competitiveness in research and innovation <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang:2022a">(<a href="#ref-Yang:2022a" role="doc-biblioref">R. Yang 2022</a>)</span>. From this viewpoint, the development of Chinese higher education reflects a blending of Western models with indigenous cultural values, particularly Confucian principles of education and statecraft.</p>
<p>While the culturalist perspective offers a compelling narrative of how Chinese universities integrate historical traditions with modern practices, it risks overlooking the material realities and global pressures that influence the development of science and technology sectors. For instance, while Yang Rui emphasizes cultural synthesis, this focus can obscure the real challenges Chinese universities face in building competitive S&amp;T capacities in a highly unequal global landscape. Where, for example, does the foundational knowledge for disciplines like quantum physics, which have no cultural antecedents in Confucian tradition, originate?</p>
<p>Moreover, the culturalist argument, much like the <em>Tianxia</em> concept used by some later scholars <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang_Marginson_etal:2024a">(<a href="#ref-Yang_Marginson_etal:2024a" role="doc-biblioref">L. Yang, Marginson, and Xu 2024</a>)</span>, tends to selectively highlight successes while ignoring the persistent inequalities and fragmentation within the global higher education system. While the blending of cultural traditions may contribute to the distinctiveness of Chinese universities, it does not fully explain how they navigate the global competition for resources, talent, and research collaborations.</p>
<p>Thus, while the culturalist perspective provides a valuable lens for understanding the historical and intellectual context of Chinese higher education, it too offers a limited view. The emphasis on cultural factors underplays the political, economic, and infrastructural challenges that are equally critical to the development of China’s S&amp;T sectors.</p>
</section>
<section id="evolutionary-institutionalism-in-higher-education" class="level2" data-number="2.3">
<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolutionary-institutionalism-in-higher-education"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Evolutionary Institutionalism in Higher Education</h2>
<p>This study applies evolutionary institutionalism to analyze the development of China’s higher education sector, particularly in science and technology (S&amp;T). Rooted in evolutionary economics, this approach views economic and institutional changes as dynamic, iterative processes characterized by continuous adaptation and experimentation. Evolutionary economists argue that such change cannot be fully understood without recognizing the roles of innovation, learning, and contingency in shaping long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>In this context, the development of Chinese higher education mirrors evolutionary principles of “variation and selection,” where diverse strategies are continually tested, some institutions gain prominence, while others may stagnate. This dynamic leads to the gradual and adaptive emergence of more effective institutional structures and practices. Chinese universities and research institutions, through the mechanisms of trial and error, are adapting to both internal pressures (e.g., talent cultivation and resource allocation) and external demands (e.g., international competition and policy shifts) over time. This perspective highlights that outcomes of these efforts often deviate from initial plans, reflecting a common theme in evolutionary theory: unpredictability in achieving new organizational forms and practices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, evolutionary institutionalism stresses <em>institutional heterogeneity and selective adaptation</em>, capturing the reality that China’s higher education landscape is neither monolithic nor uniformly successful. Instead, institutions vary in capacity, approach, and impact, a phenomenon intensified by local demands and regional conditions. For instance, while leading institutions like Peking University and Tsinghua University have successfully navigated global competition and innovation, others remain peripheral, reinforcing the evolutionary concept that only certain institutional forms thrive under specific conditions.</p>
<p>This framework also acknowledges the significant role of <em>institutional agency and feedback loops</em>, wherein universities act not merely as passive recipients of state-led reforms but as active participants in their developmental trajectories. Through these feedback loops, universities adjust to policy directives and market conditions by integrating or disregarding specific practices. Over time, these adaptive responses contribute to a complex, self-reinforcing ecosystem in which higher education institutions continuously evolve, sometimes creating entirely new pathways distinct from traditional or Western models.</p>
<p>In sum, by viewing China’s higher education sector through the lens of evolutionary institutionalism, we can better understand its development as a dynamic, adaptive process that is deeply influenced by institutional diversity, selective adaptation, and the continual, often unpredictable, interplay of endogenous and exogenous factors.</p>

<p>A key case of this evolutionary institutionalism the collaboration between mainland Chinese universities and those in Hong Kong. During the 1980s, as Chinese universities sought to modernize, they recognized Hong Kong’s rapidly developing higher education sector as a potential model for collaboration. Hong Kong, with its more established infrastructure and international connections, became an essential partner in helping China build its S&amp;T capacities. This collaboration involved the exchange of talent, resources, and knowledge, creating a virtuous cycle of “brain circulation” that benefitted both sides.</p>
<p>By the 2000s, this relationship had evolved into a well-established network of academic exchange, with Chinese universities sending their best students to Hong Kong for advanced training and research. Many of these students returned to China, bringing with them the expertise and international experience necessary to elevate China’s higher education system. This dynamic illustrates how Chinese universities did not simply imitate Western models but adapted with new practices to suit their local contexts, demonstrating a capacity for organizational learning and innovation.</p>
<p>This paper argues that China’s collaboration with Hong Kong offers a clear example of how institutional actors, through strategic partnerships and pragmatic learning, have played an active role in shaping the development of the country’s S&amp;T sectors. Moving beyond structuralist and culturalist explanations, this approach highlights the agency of universities as active participants in their own evolution.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we present our data and methods, followed by an analysis and discussion. This paper uses four data sources: bibliographic data from the Web of Science (WoS); PhD dissertation data from three universities in Hong Kong; biographies of university leaders; and university archives from these same universities. By combining these sources, we provide a comprehensive view of the science and technology sector’s development within the Chinese higher education system.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Data collection</h2>
<p>To systematically evaluate the role of Hong Kong, we collected a large-scale bibliographic dataset from multiple sources, including the Web of Science (WoS) and university libraries, along with textual data from different university archives. All data were preprocessed using <code>pandas 2.2.2</code> in <code>Python 3.10.15</code> and subsequently analyzed and visualized with <code>R 4.4.1</code>.</p>
<p>This study specifically utilizes bibliographic data from WoS to uncover the dynamics of scientific collaboration between Hong Kong and Mainland China. We focused on publications affiliated with the top three universities in Hong Kong: The University of Hong Kong (HKU), Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).</p>
<p>To ensure the relevance of our data to the S&amp;T sector, we restricted our search to publications in SCI-E journals. Within this category, we selected five types of publications: articles, review articles, proceeding papers, letters, and early access articles<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This approach yielded a total of 203,393 results as of October 14, 2024.</p>
<p>We focused on several key aspects of the metadata collected from the Web of Science (WoS): basic publication information (title, author, year of publication, and disciplinary areas), citation information (times cited), geographic information (authors’ affiliations), and sources of funding. This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing the collaboration dynamics between Hong Kong and Mainland China in the context of science and technology development.</p>
<p>Additionally, we collected PhD dissertation data from the library websites of HKU, CUHK, and HKUST. The dissertation data deepens our understanding of the scale of higher education and the academic output in Hong Kong before and after its connection with the mainland. The dataset includes dissertation titles, authors’ names, their faculties, years of completion, and disciplinary categorizations.</p>
<p>Finally, to capture historical events with regard to three universities, we downloaded annual reports from the university archives. This large-scale qualitative data complements our quantitative findings, providing a richer context for each institution. We also include biographical data from key educational leaders. Together, these datasets create a comprehensive framework for analyzing the collaboration dynamics and developmental trends within the region’s academic landscape.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodologies"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Methodologies</h2>
<p>All bibliographical data for our analysis was directly subsetted from the collected WoS metadata, except for geographic information, which was extracted from authors’ addresses using text mining techniques.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> We also exclude, from the dissertation dataset, works from non-S&amp;T departments<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We calculated the number of publications by year to assess the research capacity of the selected institutions annually and compared publication counts across institutions. The dissertation dataset was utilized to compute the scale of PhD education, as a higher number of PhD students correlates with increased dissertation output. We also mapped the countries or regions of collaboration partners associated with the three selected universities in Hong Kong to examine changes in collaboration over time.</p>
<p>To understand the collaborative relationships between Hong Kong and mainland institutions, we sample 25 top-ranked institutions in Mainland China based on the Nature Index 2024. Beyond institution-to-institution level collaboration, we further calculated the collaboration between Hong Kong and Chinese mainland provinces by year, revealing the dynamics of collaboration between Hong Kong and different regions in China.</p>

<p>In summary, this study employs a comprehensive dataset derived from bibliographic records, PhD dissertations, biographical data, and annual reports to explore the collaboration dynamics between Hong Kong and Mainland China in the S&amp;T sector. By analyzing bibliographic and dissertation data, alongside targeted qualitative data from university archives, we assess publication trends, research capacity, and collaborative patterns over time. Our methodological approach highlights the active role of academic institutions in Hong Kong and Mainland China, providing a new understanding of their evolving relationships within the context of China’s rapid development of S&amp;T sector in higher education system. In the following section, we present our analysis based on the aforementioned data.</p>

<p>How important is Hong Kong to mainland China’s research landscape? The answer is clear from the WoS data, which covers the most comprehensive records from 1980 to the present. Collaboration between regions is significant. The United States remains by far the most crucial S&amp;T partner for mainland Chinese institutions, as shown by the grey line with the steepest upward trajectory in the figures below. This pattern holds for each mainland institution we examined. Overall, China-U.S. collaboration accounts for 8.84%, rising to 21.07% among highly cited papers. Hong Kong ranks as the third most significant collaborator, contributing 2.15%, just after China-Great Britain collaborations.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The data becomes more revealing from an institutional perspective. As shown in <a href="#fig-cas-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="#fig-sjtu-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, and <a href="#fig-sysu-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, the U.S. is the top collaborator for three of China’s most decorated research institutions: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and Sun Yat-sen University. This pattern holds across the 25-institution sample.</p>

<p>A closer analysis reveals that Hong Kong has emerged as a key collaborator for many of China’s top institutions, consistently ranking among their top three partners over time. For universities in Guangdong—such as <em>Sun Yat-sen University</em>, <em>Shenzhen University</em>, <em>Southern University of Science and Technology</em>, and <em>South China University of Technology</em>—Hong Kong is typically the first or second most frequent collaborator. This partnership was especially strong from 1995 to 2015. For institutions outside Guangdong, Hong Kong generally ranks between second and fourth, depending on the year.</p>
<p>However, the collaborative relationship between Hong Kong and mainland institutions varies significantly. Two main patterns stand out: spatial proximity and temporal trends.</p>
<p>In terms of spatial proximity, institutions closer to Hong Kong (particularly those in Guangdong) have higher collaboration frequencies. This frequency tends to decrease as geographical distance from Hong Kong increases. Yet, despite the distance, major centers like Beijing and Shanghai maintain strong collaborative links with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-sysu-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, from 1990 to 2010, Hong Kong was the second most frequent collaborator for <em>Sun Yat-sen University</em>. For more distant institutions, such as Zhengzhou University, Wuhan University, and Lanzhou University—each recognized for their strength in S&amp;T—Hong Kong ranks as the third or fourth most frequent partner. This trend underscores the influence of physical distance on collaboration intensity.</p>

</div>
<p>For temporal trends, Hong Kong’s prominence in S&amp;T collaboration has varied over time. Prior to 1995, collaboration with mainland institutions was minimal. The mid-1990s marked a turning point, with Hong Kong soon rising to number 2 or 3 as a collaborative partner for most institutions in our sample. This pattern persisted into the mid-2010s when Hong Kong’s relative rank declined, not due to reduced collaboration, but because mainland China’s partnerships with other regional players sharply increased.</p>

<p>Building on the previous analysis, a key question arises: is the partnership between Hong Kong and mainland institutions unidimensional? Specifically, do mainland institutions mainly play a supporting role in their scientific collaborations with Hong Kong, or do they hold a more central, reciprocal position?</p>
<p>The answer is that this partnership is far from unidimensional. For Hong Kong universities, collaboration with mainland institutions is not only reciprocal but, in many cases, primary. Mainland universities have become some of the top contributors to Hong Kong’s research output, forming a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s international collaborations. As illustrated in <a href="#fig-hku-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>, <a href="#fig-cuhk-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, and <a href="#fig-hkust-location" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, which show the top international collaborators for the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology respectively, mainland institutions have replaced traditionally dominant regions to become Hong Kong’s most significant research collaborators. This shift began in the mid to late-1990s (CUHK: 1997, HKU: 1995, HKUST: 1998) and has remained consistent, reflecting the depth and continuity of this cross-border academic relationship.</p>
<p>For Hong Kong’s universities, the shift toward mainland partnerships underscores a growing interdependence, where mainland collaborations are essential for maintaining Hong Kong’s position in the global academic landscape. While Hong Kong universities engage in collaborations worldwide, it is the connection with mainland institutions that drives much of their scientific progress. In this way, mainland universities have replaced traditionally competitive regions like the United States and Europe by providing a steady stream of research partnerships along with a shared cultural and linguistic foundation that enables smoother and more extensive collaboration.</p>
<p>In contrast, mainland universities see Hong Kong as a valuable but supplementary partner within a broader network of international collaborations, particularly with the U.S. While mainland institutions consider Hong Kong important for advancing scientific research and expanding S&amp;T initiatives, the relationship does not hold the same central role it does for Hong Kong universities. This difference highlights a unique asymmetry: mainland universities have a diverse array of international collaborators, while Hong Kong universities increasingly depend on mainland institutions as their “lifeline” in research partnerships. This dynamic bolsters Hong Kong’s academic ecosystem and provides mainland universities with a high-quality, regional partner.</p>
<p>This asymmetry reflects a larger regional trend, where Hong Kong’s universities leverage their autonomy, resources, international reputation, and proximity to mainland institutions to create a unique collaborative synergy. Across the Shenzhen River, the academic relationship extends beyond formal agreements or joint projects; it has become foundational for Hong Kong universities’ research agendas and strategic development. Thus, while mainland institutions engage on a global scale, Hong Kong universities find in mainland China an irreplaceable collaborator, making the partnership integral to their growth in the global higher education and research arenas.</p>

<p>It is essential to note that universities in Hong Kong are not merely passive participants in collaborations with mainland institutions; they exhibit a high degree of <em>strategic agency</em> in selecting and developing their areas of expertise. This section highlights the key subject areas where Hong Kong and mainland China collaborated frequently between 1990 and 2015, a period when Hong Kong became an indispensable international partner for Chinese scientific advancement. We identify the top subject areas with high publication output and frequent collaborations for three leading Hong Kong universities.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-cuhk-subject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9</a>, <a href="#fig-hku-subject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a> and <a href="#fig-hkust-subject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10</a> display the top 1st disciplines collaborated with mainland with the number of publication descending from top to bottom. As shown in those figures, three universities share strengths in several subject areas, notably <em>electrical &amp; electronic engineering</em>, <em>oncology</em>, and <em>biochemistry &amp; molecular biology</em>. HKU and HKUST also excel in <em>applied physics</em> and <em>materials science</em>. While CUHK distinguishes itself with additional strengths in <em>pharmacology &amp; pharmacy</em> and <em>computer science</em>, reflecting a broader range of expertise. The distinct collaborating subject areas between Hong Kong and mainland display the disciplinary heterogeneity and further reveal the flexible collaborative strategy characteristic by with <em>strategic agency</em> adopted by higher education institutions in Chinese mainland.</p>

<p>Focusing further on these collaborations, we identify specific “advantage” disciplines, featured by both significant publications and high-frequent collaboration with mainland, for each university. Based on collaboration frequency and publication impact, HKU and HKUST both show an advantage in <em>electrical &amp; electronic engineering</em>, <em>applied physics</em>, and <em>multidisciplinary materials science</em>. Meanwhile, CUHK excels in <em>electrical &amp; electronic engineering</em>, <em>biochemistry &amp; molecular biology</em>, and <em>artificial intelligence in computer science</em>. These selected subject areas exhibit notable growth, evidenced by publication counts and citation impact metrics, demonstrating these disciplines’ significant role in attracting mainland scholars to establish robust academic networks with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The following figures display the development trends in these disciplines at each university from 1990 to 2015, as seen in <a href="#fig-hku-topsubject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>, <a href="#fig-cuhk-topsubject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12</a>, and <a href="#fig-hkust-topsubject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>. The increasing publication numbers and high citation impact in these fields underscore their prominent status and growing expertise, which have effectively drawn mainland collaboration to Hong Kong’s highly specialized institutions.</p>

<p>Overall, the evolution of these highly collaborative and productive disciplines reveals a dynamic pattern that extends beyond passive cooperation. The evidence suggests that Hong Kong’s specialized strengths have acted as a “pull factor” for Chinese mainland institutions, prompting them to pursue deeper collaboration with Hong Kong’s established research hubs. This collaboration has allowed Hong Kong to play an active role in shaping the mainland’s S&amp;T development, particularly in these advanced fields.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the evolving partnership between Hong Kong and mainland China warrants further exploration to understand the underlying drivers. A longitudinal analysis of collaboration intensity reveals that from 1990 to 2015, Hong Kong emerged as a critical partner, with several key subject areas—<em>engineering</em>, <em>physics</em>, <em>biochemistry &amp; molecular biology</em>, <em>materials science</em>, and <em>computer science</em>—anchoring this collaboration. While current data illustrate the breadth of these partnerships, further empirical investigation will be necessary to unravel how these cooperative models have been shaped by evolutionary and professional dynamics.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we have demonstrated that research collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China is both reciprocal and significant—second only to the Sino-U.S. relationship in terms of importance for China’s S&amp;T growth. This collaboration varies across geographic regions and shifts over time, revealing a complex, evolving pattern. But a key question remains: why does this pattern exist? To address this, we offer three explanations: (1) the role of key individuals who served as crucial points of contact, (2) the timing of developmental changes in Hong Kong’s S&amp;T sector, and (3) the strategic location of Hong Kong as a bridge for mainland China’s scientific development.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="points-of-contact"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Points of Contact</h3>
<p>The collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China in S&amp;T has been greatly influenced by key individuals who facilitated connections. On the mainland side, ever since the mid-1970s—before the end of the Cultural Revolution—Chinese scientists began welcoming international visitors <span class="citation" data-cites="Suttmeier:1980a">(<a href="#ref-Suttmeier:1980a" role="doc-biblioref">Suttmeier 1980</a>)</span>. Following the Nixon Shock in 1971, prominent overseas Chinese scientists, such as Nobel laureate Yang Chen-Ning, visited China, discovering both a damaged scientific infrastructure and a generation of Chinese S&amp;T talents eager to learn <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang:2016a">(<a href="#ref-Yang:2016a" role="doc-biblioref">J. Yang 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These renowned scientists, many of whom had established themselves abroad, became conduits for collaboration, eagerly creating channels to assist Chinese scientists and providing valuable <em>feedback loops</em> between mainland institutions and overseas counterparts. Through their efforts, knowledge and practices circulated in both directions, enhancing the capacity of Chinese institutions while keeping them connected to global scientific advancements.</p>
<p>A prime example is Chinese Nobel laureate Lee Tsung-Dao’s China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA) program, established following his visit to China. In collaboration with top mainland institutions such as CAS, PKU, and Tsinghua, CUSPEA sent over 900 Chinese physics students to U.S. universities between 1979 and 1989 <span class="citation" data-cites="Shen_Zhao:2001a">(<a href="#ref-Shen_Zhao:2001a" role="doc-biblioref">Shen and Zhao 2001</a>)</span>, playing a critical role in fostering early international exposure for Chinese researchers.</p>
<p>At the time, formal mechanisms for such exchanges were lacking, as the China Scholarship Council would only be established in 1996. Consequently, points of contact relied heavily on personal connections and institutional ties (i.e.&nbsp;Shaw <span class="citation" data-cites="Shaw:2013a">(<a href="#ref-Shaw:2013a" role="doc-biblioref">2013, 145</a>)</span>). In addition to Lee’s initiative, many overseas Chinese scientists were individually approached by mainland institutions. Figures like physicist Woo Chia-Wei (later the founding president of HKUST) and plant biologist Kung Shain-dow (later Dean of Science at HKUST) regularly hosted Chinese visitors <span class="citation" data-cites="Woo:2007a Kung:2000a">(<a href="#ref-Woo:2007a" role="doc-biblioref">2007, 35</a>; <a href="#ref-Kung:2000a" role="doc-biblioref">2000, 110</a>)</span>. This relatively small circle of prominent overseas Chinese scientists <span class="citation" data-cites="Chi:2014a">(<a href="#ref-Chi:2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Ch’i 2014</a>)</span> —many of whom were politically inclined to support mainland China <span class="citation" data-cites="Shaw:2013a">(<a href="#ref-Shaw:2013a" role="doc-biblioref">Shaw 2013</a>)</span> —became pivotal facilitators of exchange.</p>
<p>Among these figures, Woo Chia-Wei stands out. Woo’s first visit to the PRC was in 1978, during a four-month sabbatical when he visited Fudan University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) <span class="citation" data-cites="Woo:2007a">(<a href="#ref-Woo:2007a" role="doc-biblioref">Woo 2007</a>)</span>. Then a faculty member at Northwestern University, Woo arranged for Chinese physicists to visit his institution, fostering early ties. Although Woo moved to become President of San Francisco State University (SFSU), his eventual return to Hong Kong as the founding president of HKUST (1991-2001) rekindled his mainland connections. In his second year as president, Woo led HKUST’s management team on a visit to the mainland <span class="citation" data-cites="Chi:2014a">(<a href="#ref-Chi:2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Ch’i 2014, 226</a>)</span>, initiating a series of bilateral exchanges and collaborations that solidified ties.</p>
<!-- \<we can think of ways to illustrate this point. using annual report data? \> -->
<p>HKUST was not alone in reaching out to mainland China. Yang Chen-Ning joined CUHK as a Distinguished Professor in 1986, and Fields Medalist Yau Shing-Tung followed in 1993 <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang:2016a">Yau and Nadis (<a href="#ref-Yau_Nadis:2019a" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. Both scholars attracted mainland students and further solidified academic ties. On the mainland side, institutions like CAS, Zhejiang University, and Fudan University also played pivotal roles. CAS President Zhou Guangzhao, for instance, was awarded an honorary doctorate by CUHK in 1991 and served on HKUST’s Presidential Advisory Board as the sole representative from the mainland <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhou:1991a">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (<a href="#ref-The-Hong-Kong-University-of-Science-and-Technology:1992a" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>To understand why Hong Kong became a prime collaborator for mainland China in the late 1990s, it is essential to examine the evolution of Hong Kong’s higher education landscape. As illustrated in <a href="#fig-dissertation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;14</a>, Hong Kong universities functioned primarily as teaching institutions with limited research activity until the mid-1990s. The figure shows the trend in PhD dissertations in S&amp;T fields across four representative Hong Kong universities, revealing a surge in the number of eligible PhD students starting in 1994, which continued to grow steadily until 2020. This upward trend in PhD dissertations demonstrates not only the expansion of Hong Kong’s research programs but also its emergence as a regional education hub, particularly attractive to students from nearby regions, including mainland China.</p>
<p>This shift toward research-focused education in Hong Kong was not only reflected in publication output but also in the increasing numbers of research-trained PhD graduates. Physicist Chih-Yung Chien noted in his autobiography that when he became the founding Dean of Science at HKUST, a survey of HKU and CUHK showed that only 5% of students were enrolled in research PhD programs <span class="citation" data-cites="Chien:2024a">(<a href="#ref-Chien:2024a" role="doc-biblioref">Chien 2024</a>)</span>. By setting an ambitious target of 30% for research enrollment, HKUST signaled a transformative shift in Hong Kong’s academic landscape. This shift coincided with a substantial intake of mainland students beginning in 1995, creating a collaborative exchange that went beyond a simple transfer of knowledge. Instead, it fostered a process of <em>iterative learning</em>, where both Hong Kong and mainland China’s academic ecosystems grew richer and more interconnected through this dynamic exchange.</p>

<p>Further insight into Hong Kong’s S&amp;T growth emerges when examining the cultivation of PhD programs across disciplines. <a href="#fig-dissertation-subject" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;15</a> illustrates the distribution of PhD dissertations by subject areas across three prominent Hong Kong universities, reflecting the potential scale of researchers in each discipline and indicating which fields were prioritized. Despite each university having distinct advantage disciplines, certain fields consistently rank among the top five across institutions, including <em>chemistry</em>, <em>engineering</em>, <em>biology</em>, and <em>computer science</em>. The prevalence of these disciplines highlights their prominence in Hong Kong’s academic landscape, contributing to the regional expertise that mainland universities sought to collaborate with.</p>
<p>The data on PhD dissertations align closely with the top subject areas for collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China, partially explaining why certain disciplines became central to cross-border partnerships. This pattern suggests that collaboration tends to occur in fields where the early-developed institution demonstrates stronger professional capacity and performance, motivating the late-developing institution to learn from and emulate its partner. The consistency across subject areas reinforces that mainland institutions strategically seek partnerships with Hong Kong’s top disciplines, further strengthening both regions’ research outputs.</p>

<p>The advanced development of Hong Kong’s S&amp;T sector—evidenced by rising publication counts and increasing numbers of PhD graduates—offered Chinese higher education institutions an attractive, accessible model with robust academic capacity and geographical proximity. With lower physical and cultural barriers compared to other international collaborators, Hong Kong provided mainland China with a readily accessible example of S&amp;T excellence. Before mainland universities fully developed their own research capacities, Hong Kong’s flourishing S&amp;T sector served as a valuable learning resource for late-developing regions like China. Hong Kong’s strong S&amp;T performance, measured by publication volume and impact, attracted a growing number of mainland students, establishing a virtuous cycle of academic exchange and collaboration. For example, when HKUST was newly established in the 1990–91 academic year, it welcomed its first batch of mainland graduate students <span class="citation" data-cites="Chi:2014a">(<a href="#ref-Chi:2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Ch’i 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>From <a href="#tbl-phd-graduates" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>, it is evident that the three flagship Hong Kong universities—HKU, CUHK, and HKUST—lacked robust “advanced research programs” during the 1980s and possibly throughout the first half of the 1990s. Due to limitations in Hong Kong’s statistical reports, which aggregate research master’s and PhD enrollment figures, precise PhD enrollment data are unavailable. For context, in 1993, the combined enrollment of research students was 845 at HKU, 852 at CUHK, and 330 at HKUST. Consequently, we rely on PhD thesis data as a proxy for analyzing trends in research student populations. Given the typical time lag of approximately three years between PhD admission and thesis completion, PhD thesis output can provide an estimated measure of earlier student enrollment sizes.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#tbl-phd-graduates" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>, annual PhD graduations at each university did not surpass 100 students until around 2000, indicating a relatively small PhD student body in the 1990s. We further analyzed graduates’ names based on thesis records to estimate the number of students originating from mainland China.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The proportion of mainland students varies across institutions: CUHK and HKUST demonstrate a higher proportion of mainland students, while HKU’s numbers are relatively lower. Here, universities in Hong Kong exhibit significant <em>institutional heterogeneity and selective adaptation</em>; they responded to new opportunities by admitting mainland students even in the absence of a formal, systematic framework. This flexibility not only allowed Hong Kong institutions to fill their research programs but also directly supported their expansion on the research side. Mainland students thus joined Hong Kong’s emerging research universities at a critical juncture, supporting these institutions’ growth as they expanded their advanced research programs.</p>

<p>The advanced growth and rapid development of Hong Kong’s S&amp;T sector likely served as a catalyst, prompting Chinese universities to increasingly seek partnerships with Hong Kong in the late 1990s. Since academic achievement and S&amp;T advancement rely heavily on publication volume and the expansion of research teams, we support this hypothesis by examining the growth trends in academic publications and the increasing scale of PhD student enrollment in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-pub-all" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;16</a>, a comparison of publication outputs from 1990 to 2015 reveals that the academic performance of two leading Hong Kong universities—the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong—surpassed that of many mainland institutions. This prior development in Hong Kong’s academic achievement highlights its collaborative potential and appeal for mainland institutions during that era.</p>

<p>The spatial distribution of S&amp;T collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China reveals two prominent trends. First, Beijing plays an unparalleled role in this relationship. Although geographically distant from Hong Kong, the collaboration between institutions in Beijing and Hong Kong surpasses any other mainland region. Data from CUHK, HKU, and HKUST show that Beijing alone contributed 13,416 co-authored papers from 1980 to 2023, eclipsing even Guangdong Province, which, despite its proximity, generated 12,039 papers in collaboration with Hong Kong institutions over the same period.</p>
<p>The dominant role of Beijing in China’s scientific landscape is expected, given that it is home to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the nation’s premier research institution. Since its establishment, CAS has been central to China’s S&amp;T development. In the early 1980s, CAS was responsible for over one-third of China’s total S&amp;T output by our calculation. Although CAS’s proportional contribution has decreased in recent years, it still accounted for approximately 10% of the nation’s S&amp;T publications in 2018. This decline is not indicative of CAS’s waning significance; rather, it reflects the rapid growth of other Chinese research institutions, which have expanded the overall pool of national scientific output.</p>
<p>In addition to its substantial research contributions, CAS has been a primary facilitator of S&amp;T collaboration. CAS leadership was proactive in identifying and establishing partnerships with international and regional collaborators, playing a strategic role in China’s global S&amp;T outreach. CAS frequently served as a first point of contact for visiting foreign scientists, leading to many enduring collaborations. It also actively pursued partnerships abroad, establishing connections that shaped the trajectory of China’s scientific network.</p>
<p>One example of CAS’s role in fostering Hong Kong-mainland collaborations occurred in 1991, well before Hong Kong had developed its own research university system. CAS President Zhou Guangzhao visited CUHK and HKUST, receiving an honorary doctorate from CUHK and becoming the only mainland member on HKUST’s Presidential Advisory Board.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Zhou’s subsequent visit to HKU in 1995, where he was awarded another honorary degree, further underscored CAS’s commitment to forming cross-border academic connections. These high-profile visits served not only as ceremonial gestures but also as strategic moves to catalyze institutional collaborations, an example of <em>organizational reflexivity</em>, as Zhou’s colleagues within CAS followed his example by establishing research partnerships and joint labs with Hong Kong institutions.</p>
<p>CAS-HKUST collaborations underscore this point. Below are the visits from CAS leadership to HKUST from the university’s founding until Hong Kong was handed over to the PRC:</p>
<ul>
<li>1991-92, 1992-93: Zhou Guangzhao, President of CAS</li>
<li>1993.10.28-31: Xu Zhihong, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1994.3.21: Teng Teng, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1994.8.24: Xu Zhihong, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1994.8.26: First joint marine research lab established between HKUST and CAS in Sanya, Hainan</li>
<li>1994.9.29: Li Zhensheng, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1994.12.15: Lu Yongxiang, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1995.3.16-17: Yi Xunyan, Vice President of CAS, along with Zhu Xuan, Deputy Secretary General and Director of Bureau of Planning and Finance, CAS</li>
<li>1995.5.25: Chen Yiyu, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1995.11.4: Lu Yongxiang, Vice President of CAS</li>
<li>1995.11.13: Hong Zhongxiang, Director, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS</li>
<li>1997.1.10: Second joint research lab established in microelectronics</li>
<li>1998: Third joint research lab established in nanotechnology</li>
</ul>
<p>While CAS occupies a unique position within China’s S&amp;T establishment, the collaboration patterns become more geographically distinct when excluding Beijing and Shanghai (another S&amp;T hub with historical and industrial connections to Hong Kong). Proximity emerges as a key factor in S&amp;T collaboration, with Guangdong Province serving as the primary regional partner for Hong Kong institutions. The degree of collaboration generally decreases with distance from Hong Kong, especially in an era when long-distance communication and frequent travel were limited (from 1980 to 2000). Given these constraints, the relative ease of access made collaboration with geographically closer regions, such as Guangdong, more feasible and productive.</p>
<p>A second factor reinforcing collaboration between Guangdong and Hong Kong is Guangdong’s unique educational landscape. Despite being an economic powerhouse and early recipient of investment from Hong Kong, Guangdong has historically lacked comprehensive research universities. The province hosts a limited number of higher education institutions, including Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), South China Normal University (SCNU, primarily a teaching institution for much of its history), South China University of Technology (SCUT), and, more recently, Shenzhen University (SZU). This limited academic infrastructure prompted Guangdong to establish close ties with Hong Kong’s universities to enhance its scientific and technological capabilities.</p>
<p>Driven by a desire to leverage its economic strength, Guangdong initiated several key partnerships with Hong Kong institutions. For instance, in the 1990s, Guangdong and HKUST collaborated to establish industrial parks aimed at fostering joint research and development. Later, Guangdong invited universities from Hong Kong to open satellite campuses, as seen with CUHK and HKUST. These initiatives have not only reinforced the collaborative network between the two regions but also provided Guangdong access to Hong Kong’s robust academic resources, allowing both areas to mutually benefit from each other’s strengths. Through such measures, the collaborative efforts between Guangdong and Hong Kong have become increasingly institutionalized and strategically aligned, fostering a dynamic regional S&amp;T partnership.</p>
<p>In this context, the spatial pattern of S&amp;T collaboration between Hong Kong and the mainland reflects both strategic institutional choices and logistical considerations, influenced by historical, geographic, and technological factors.</p>
<!-- This pattern is not surprising. Leaders from Chinese universities were often the first to visit. This is evident from reading university archives. Take HKUST, for example. The university, newly established in the 1990–91 academic year, welcomed its first batch of students [@Chien:2024a]. In its second year, Professor Zhou Guangzhao, then the director of Chinese Academy of Sciences, was invited to join the presidential advisory board as the only representative from the mainland. In June 1992, a delegation of six eminent Chinese scientists, led by Professor Zhang Cun-hao, Director of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, visited the new campus. The delegation included Urology Specialist Wu Jieping, President of Fudan University Hua Zhongyi, Agronomy Expert Lu Liangshu, Professor Tan Jiazhen, and Physicist Professor Li Lin. They proposed initiating collaboration between their respective institutions and the new university.

In the following year, even before graduating any students, HKUST received numerous visits from Chinese university leaders. The visitors included presidents from Huaqiao University, University of Science and Technology of China, Ningbo University, Fuzhou University, Shantou University, Xiamen University, Hunan University, Guangzhou University, Peking University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Additionally, ministerial and provincial leaders also visited, including the director of the Spark Program, officials from the State Science and Technology Commission, representatives of the China Association for International Science and Technology Cooperation, the Science and Technology Commission of Jiangsu Province, the State Science and Technology Committee, and the Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology. In 1994-95, a joint marine research lab was established between HKUST and CAS in Sanya, Hainan province, an example of *organizational reflexivity*. All these visits occurred before Hong Kong's 1997 handover to mainland China.

Zhejiang University's then president, Lu Yongxiang, said this after his visit to Hong Kong [@Lu:2012a]:

>Although our country is still a developing country, the partners and competitors around us are developed capitalist countries. Due to the rapid development of China's economy, Europeans, Americans, and Japanese have all come here. They are optimistic about the Chinese market and hope to find outlets for their products in China. They bring in management, technology, and capital, but importantly, they bring competition. To elevate our national industries and secure a foothold in the world, universities and research institutions must not set low goals for their disciplines; they need to aim at the forefront of global competition. We cannot advocate for solely developing and producing everything from scratch now, as it does not conform to global trends or the historical rules of scientific development. (p.270-1) -->

## About the Funding sources

Note:

Currently, I haven't found a proper way to present these not-really-structured data except the word cloud since the funding name can be varied from a single funding source and to aggregate funding information takes a ton of time.

Facts: A round-trip support

  - Initially the funding comes from NIS (mainly from the US government) and the Hong Kong Government before 2000.
    - Dr. Zhou's assumption approved here, as the initial collaborating utilized money from Hong Kong and (mainly) the United States. That is, the collaboration with Hong Kong seems the crack to the money issue from mainland teams or students.
  - Later (2000-2010) NSFC becomes the main funding source of the collaboration projects. Indicates with the growth of Chinese economy,
  - After 2010, especially 2015-2020, local funding from China (e.g. provincial natural science foundation or science and technology associations) entered the game.

However:
    
  - Can't quantify (so basically we can't do further analysis based on) the funding sources at the current stage as most funding information comes from string data and the cleaning procedure can take years.
    
  - Whether it should be included in the manuscript or a supplementary material on the presentation.

## About the dynamic of collaboration within Provinces in China

Facts: Started from Beijing, then a rapid growth in Guangdong, but mainly with eastern coastal areas

- Align with our assumption, leading research institutes in China takes the first mover advantage of Hong Kong (also the money for no doubt) to develop their global collaboration network with Hong Kong.
  - Were leading institutes in China mainly located in Beijing in the 90s.
  - The expansion of higher education in China in the early Y2K enables other areas, especially Guangdong due to its close distance to Hong Kong, to expand the collaboration with Hong Kong.
  - We also illustrated the dynamic of the scale on the research collaboration between Hong Kong and other provinces among mainland China based on the co-authorship data.
    - Present 3 figures from 1995-2010-2023 (whether bar-charts or a heatmap TBD), but an animation on the web doc.

Just stories with no further judgement.

# Discussion

TBD: 

## The reason why Hong Kong act as a pivotal collaborating region, location convenience/temporal disparity/subject areas disparity

My question is: is Hong Kong really a "pivotal" region? It might be a note connecting multiple ends. 

BUT, According to the analysis, evidances are: 

FOR THE LOCATION CONVENIENCE: If we analysis the convenience of location (i.e. the geographical things):   
- Although U.S. is the top 1 collaborator for many institutions in Mainland China, given the area and population of Hong Kong, the current scale of collaboration is significant. 
- The reason why Hong Kong initially not have a significant collaboration with institutes located in Guangdong rather in Beijing (which is way far from southern China) might because of the unequally development in the 90s. With CAS and institutes in Beijing, the capital of China, firstly leads the S&T development of China. - WE NEED EVIDENCE. 

FOR THE TEMPORAL DISPARITY (first comers advantages?):   
- Hong Kong starts its expansion of higher education system from 1994 and the figures before showed its effects. 
- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2057150X211073453: The growth of higher education, on the other hand, was rather slow until the mid-1980s. In the early 1980s, less than 2% of school-age youth had access to university (Post, 2003; SW Wu, 2008), with a 12.79% gross enrollment rate in tertiary education in 1984 (UNESCO, 2021). The first wave of higher education expansion in Hong Kong started in the late 1980s. In 1988, then Governor of Hong Kong Sir David Wilson initiated a plan to increase college enrollment to 14.5% of the population aged 17–20 by 1995 (Ahrens, 2019). In 1989, the target was modified to 18% by 1995, aiming to triple the 6% higher education enrollment rate of 1988 (Education Commission, 1988). Under his plan, the amount of first-year, first-degree undergraduate intake places rose from 5397 in 1987–1988 to 14,253 in 1994–1995 (UGC, 2021), with an average annual growth rate of 23.4% over seven years.

FOR SUBJECT AREAS
- Most collaborations happens on the field of material sciences, computer science and 

FOR MONEY AND RESOURCES
- Those depercated Funding things TBD

## talk with the theoretical framework, supporting the third view

The key point: 

> This framework emphasizes the role of institutional actors in shaping their own development through reflection, experimentation, and strategic adaptation, rather than being passive recipients of external pressures or cultural legacies. 

How: 
  - Mainland S&T assocs visit Hong Kong in 90s? <- Annual report 
  - You name it. 

> This approach shifts the focus from viewing universities as merely responding to external or historical forces, to understanding them as active agents in an ongoing, dynamic process of institutional transformation.

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>This paper examines the rapid rise of China’s higher education system in science and technology (S&amp;T), with a specific focus on Hong Kong’s often-overlooked influence. Moving beyond structuralist and cultural explanations, we use an evolutionary institutional framework to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of China’s academic and scientific development. Through analyzing cross-border collaborations between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese universities, we show that China’s S&amp;T success results not solely from government-led initiatives or historical cultural factors. Instead, this evolution has been significantly shaped by institutional actors engaging in experimentation, strategic adaptation, and mutual exchange.</p>
<p>In China’s higher education sector, institutional actors embrace learning as a continuous, iterative process, frequently testing new strategies without a fixed goal. These actors adapt as resources and constraints shift, underscoring Herbert Simon’s insight that in complex environments, choices cannot be fully optimized due to bounded rationality <span class="citation" data-cites="Simon:1955a">(<a href="#ref-Simon:1955a" role="doc-biblioref">H. A. Simon 1955</a>)</span> . Accordingly, Chinese universities and research institutions do not seek to optimize their strategies but pursue routines that yield viable outcomes. This adaptive approach aligns with Richard Nelson’s assertion that institutions respond to changing contexts through “learning and selection” forces, enabling effective routines to endure and evolve <span class="citation" data-cites="Nelson:2018a">(<a href="#ref-Nelson:2018a" role="doc-biblioref">R. R. Nelson 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s role as a key partner in this development highlights the power of regional collaboration and innovation <span class="citation" data-cites="Nelson:2013a">Saxenian (<a href="#ref-Saxenian:2006a" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. Its role has often been overlooked due to two primary factors: attention frequently focuses on the prominent China-U.S. collaboration in science and technology <span class="citation" data-cites="Crow:2022a">Hao and Hua (<a href="#ref-Hao_Hua:2023a" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>, while secondary yet crucial collaborations receive less focus; and the collaborative relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China varies by S&amp;T discipline and the geographic location of mainland institutions, complicating cohesive analysis. By integrating diverse data sources, this study offers a comprehensive view of this partnership, showing how Hong Kong’s unique academic environment—marked by autonomy and robust international ties—provides a supportive space for mainland Chinese students and scholars. This “cross-border knowledge exchange” blends mainland talent with Hong Kong’s academic resources and freedoms. Unlike typical study-abroad scenarios where Chinese S&amp;T students often remain overseas—resulting in brain drain—this partnership with Hong Kong encourages graduates to return to mainland China. This cycle, where students gain advanced training and then bring expertise back to China, reduces talent loss and strengthens both regions’ academic and scientific communities.</p>
<p>This cross-border dynamic has also introduced new institutional models, including provincial-level joint research facilities, civil servant professional development programs, and graduate student exchanges—initiatives challenging to replicate with more distant partners. Hong Kong reciprocates by welcoming mainland students with generous scholarships, training them in advanced research environments featuring world-class faculty. These interactions establish a “knowledge transfer loop,” where students receive advanced training in Hong Kong and return to China for academic roles, reinforcing both Hong Kong’s research sector and China’s scientific capacity. This mutually beneficial flow supports Hong Kong’s rapid rise in higher education, particularly in research <span class="citation" data-cites="Postiglione:2011a">(<a href="#ref-Postiglione:2011a" role="doc-biblioref">Postiglione 2011</a>)</span>, while avoiding saturation in its job market and bolstering China’s educational system.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the need for a historically grounded, context-sensitive analysis of higher education development. The evolutionary framework offers a fresh perspective on how institutions change through reflexivity, diversity, and strategic adaptation to local and global forces. This framework shows that China’s S&amp;T rise is not merely a top-down narrative but a complex, adaptive process in which universities leverage partnerships—particularly with Hong Kong—to overcome institutional limitations and foster innovation. Recognizing Hong Kong’s role within this framework broadens our understanding of the forces shaping China’s S&amp;T landscape, suggesting that sustainable growth requires both internal reform and external partnerships, along with adaptability to global shifts.</p>
<p>This historical perspective has implications for future higher education policy, emphasizing that fostering inter-regional collaborations and institutional flexibility are essential strategies for advancing academic excellence and innovation. Through these cross-border partnerships, China’s higher education system can experiment, adapt, and integrate new knowledge, contributing to its rapid growth in science and technology. By highlighting these adaptive and collaborative dynamics, this paper expands the discussion on how institutional networks and partnerships drive S&amp;T development in non-Western contexts, illuminating pathways for innovation in a globally interconnected academic landscape.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The initial analysis includes all five types of publications. We added two additional types to the three used by <span class="citation" data-cites="Wagner_Zhang_etal:2022a">Wagner, Zhang, and Leydesdorff (<a href="#ref-Wagner_Zhang_etal:2022a" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>: conference proceedings and early-access research papers. Since we are not studying citation counts but rather production volume, including these two types will not inflate our numbers and allows for a more inclusive view of research output.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>To process location and geographic information, author addresses from the Web of Science data were first divided according to their specific comma-separated format. Each address was split into multiple columns to capture details such as room number, street, city, and country or region. After segmenting the data, we applied a mapping chart to link each city to its corresponding province. For addresses containing typographical errors, we manually identified and corrected them by examining similarities in spelling or structure, ensuring greater accuracy in the dataset. Given our primary focus on collaboration between Hong Kong and Mainland China, we adhered to WoS’s definition of inter-regional collaboration—where a paper with at least two authors from different regions indicates collaboration. This approach allowed us to narrow the dataset to include only publications involving researchers from both Hong Kong and Mainland China, highlighting the collaborative dynamics between these regions.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>To classify the dissertations into Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and non-S&amp;T categories, we primarily used the faculty affiliation of each dissertation. This approach aligns with established institutional norms, where faculties such as engineering, computer science, and physical sciences are associated with S&amp;T fields, while faculties like Chinese, arts, humanities, and social sciences fall under non-S&amp;T. In cases of ambiguity, particularly with recent interdisciplinary programs, we cross-referenced departmental charters and institutional directories to ensure accurate classification. Additionally, we adhered to the UNESCO nomenclature (see #tbl-nomenclature-st and #tbl-nomenclature-non-st in Appendix A) for fields of science and technology<span class="citation" data-cites="unesco-nomenclature">(<a href="#ref-unesco-nomenclature" role="doc-biblioref">UNESCO 1988</a>)</span>, further validating our faculty-based classification. For departments that straddled both categories, we conducted a manual review of the universities’ archives to avoid misclassification, ensuring a rigorous and systematic approach to distinguishing between S&amp;T and non-S&amp;T fields.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Due to the complex methods employed by the WoS to determine the location of each paper, including whether they are affiliated with Hong Kong, we cannot provide an accurate count within the time constraints. The percentage presented here is an estimate based on the collaboration rates between HKU, CUHK, and HKUST and their mainland counterparts, derived from the data we collected from WoS.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Due to time constraints preventing us from further analysis, these figures encompass students from all disciplines.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Zhou also delivered a moving speech in Hong Kong. See <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhou:1991a">G. Zhou (<a href="#ref-Zhou:1991a" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
